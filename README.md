## Overview
The Purpose of this Analysis was to determine employees who had a high likelihood of retiring within the next year and determine who will be eligible for a mentorship program within the company to help with getting new hires up to speed.

## Results

- A table (retirement_titles) has been generated of all the employees that will be retiring soon. This list also shows all other positions that these individuals have had within the company prior to their current position.
